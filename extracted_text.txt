Message from the Chair  
Welcome to the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at North South University 
(NSU). Whether you are a prospective or current student, a prospective faculty member, a parent, an 
alumnus, a government or industry representative, or just a curious onlooker, I encourage you to browse 
and find detailed information about our graduate and undergraduate programs, our faculty members, 
their research interests, and the broad range of activities underway in the Dep artment.  
I believe, the department is the most forward -looking, vibrant and dynamic department at North South 
University (NSU). Since its inception in 1993 with a handful of students and only one undergraduate 
program in Computer Science, the department has grown t o be the largest department at NSU with 
more than 54 full -time faculty members, 35 part -time and visiting faculty members, approximately 5500 
undergraduate students and 200 master’s students.  
The ECE Department is committed to provide an outstanding educational experience for its students and 
prepare them for the highest personal and professional growth. We believe in student -centered and 
practice -oriented education to train the future workforc e and meet the challenges of existing and 
emerging technologies of the 21st century. Thus we focus on hiring outstanding faculty members from 
home and abroad, incorporate outcome based education system and build state -of-the-art teaching 
facilities and res earch laboratories. Very recently, the department received accreditation for all its 
undergraduate programs from the Board of Accreditation for Engineering and Technical Education 
(BAETE), Bangladesh. At present, the department is actively seeking accredit ation from the Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), USA.  
Our students are broadly encouraged to gain out -of-the-classroom academic and research experiences, 
produce engineering and scientific publications, and participate in various co -curricular activities. In 
order to foster these activities, the department ma intains program -oriented and student -centric 
engineering forums such as ACM and IEEE Student Branches.  
We offer undergraduate and master’s degrees in three different disciplines: Computer Science and 
Engineering (CSE), Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) and Electronic and Telecommunication 
Engineering (ETE). These disciplines are highly synergetic,  and since they are together in a single 
department it gives us a unique advantage in making new discoveries and innovation for our students 
and faculty members.  
The department is very proud of its outstanding faculty members, all of whom have MS and/or Ph.D. 
degrees primarily from the USA, Canada, UK, Japan, and Australia. We believe our department is the top 
destination for faculty members who are willing to retu rn to Bangladesh from abroad.  
Thank you for your interest in the Department of ECE at NSU. If you have any query, please do not 
hesitate to contact me personally through  rajesh.palit@northsouth.edu .

Computer and Engineering Club  
 
North South University Computer and Engineering Club (NSU CEC) is the one and only 
Engineering club in ECE department of North South University, established in Fall 2015, 
affiliated from three of the most reputed clubs of NSU, which are NSU Computer Club 
(NSUCC), NSU Wireless Forum (NSU WF) and NSU Society of Science, Engineering and 
Technology (NSU SSET). NSUCEC has devoted itself towards one large goal, ‘Creating Tech 
Leaders of Tomorrow’, with all the active members of CC, WF, and SSET. The main objecti ve of 
NSUCEC is to promote the ECE department of NSU to offer an extensive study of the IT and 
Telecom industries of Bangladesh through seminars, workshops, publications and study tours. It 
is also the mission of NSUCEC to create a relationship between ind ustries and the academy.  
 
  
NSU CEC has already begun its journey with very promising results by organizing the 
Orientation program of TOP -UP IT training program in NSU run by the IT Division of Bangladesh 
Government. We received over 600 membership requests from the NSU students. Mo reover, 
also participated in the NSU Club Fair 2015 by setting up an elegant booth where participants 
challenged each other into dance battles on many different famous songs. Soon later, CEC 
arranged a field trip as a means of an ice -breaking program for t he new recruits. NSUCEC also 
got the opportunity to organize the mega computing event ACM ICPC for the previous three 
years and a public lecture on ‘The Frontiers of Science and Pathways for Discoveries in the 21st 
century’ delivered by Dr. Zahid Hasan, on  26th November 2015 in the campus auditorium of 
NSU. Besides, NSUCEC also organized their own event, Info Fest V.2 included three 
informative seminars regarding information technology and featured a workshop on Robotics for 
technology enthusiast NSU studen ts. The event tagline was, “Technology for future”. NSU 
hosted its first ‘Capstone Project Showcase’ on 1st December 2015 which was organized by the 
members of CEC. NSUCEC participated in the 24 years celebration of NSU which took place 
from 3rd March to 1 1th March 2016. Throughout the celebration NSUCEC had a booth which 
was an instant hit. NSUCEC also arranged different programs of the grand celebration event 
including the Tech Giant Meet -Up (Season 1) in collaboration with NSU Alumni Association of 
School of Engineering and Physical Sciences (AASEPS). After that, NSUCEC arranged a 
Women Techmakers seminar in the middle of March 2016 by Women Techmakers group, which 
is associated with GDG. Along with that, a seminar on NASA space app challenge by BASIS 
Students Forum was also organized. In October 2016, NSUCEC hosted a pro gram on Digital 
World 2016 campus activation in collaboration with BASIS Students Forum. NSUCEC has 
organized its major event Cybernauts, which is one of the biggest National IT events in all over 
Bangladesh. This was a 4 -day long event which was held from  28th to 31st October 2016 where 
it covers 4 competitions: National Programming Contest, Line Follower Robotics Contest, 
Engineering Project Showcase, and Cyber Athletics. NSUCEC has conducted a seminar on 
“Career in freelancing” by Codertrust, which is a freelancing training institute of Bangladesh. In 
January 2017, BASIS SoftExpo campus activation program was arranged by NSUCEC in 
collaboration with BASIS Students Forum.   
NSU CEC organized Cybernauts 2018 from 18th to 25th March 2018 with segments including 
National Programming Contest, Engineering Project Showcase (Senior and Junior Level), Line 
Follower Robot Contest and Cyber Athletics.  
For the very first time, ‘Cybernauts’ provided an opportunity to the students of schools & 
colleges to showcase their talents and innovative skills in the Junior Division of the Engineering 
Project Showcase. More than 1000 tech -lover participants from all over Bangladesh had 
participated in this platform for sharing their unique experiences. Moreover, champion teams & 
runner -up teams won total prize money worth 500k taka, gift vouchers and a lot more of exciting 
goodies. On December 2018, NSUCEC organized R oboQuest v1.0 primarily consisting of two 
segments, Robo Fight, and Robo Soccer. Robo fight was the segment in which two or more 
custom -built robots created by participating NSU students used various tactics to destroy or 
disable their competitor’s robot. Robo Soccer, on the other hand, used custom -built robots to 
orchestrate a unique game of soccer between teams consisting of robot players. Both the 
segments were incredibly amusing to the audience and kept them on the edge of their seats for 
the entire dur ation. The champion & runner -up teams won total prize money worth 75k, gift 
vouchers, and many more exciting goodies. The organizers of this competition think this 
daylong event was a potent platform for the students of NSU to demonstrate their skills and 
innovative ideas on robotics and achieve practical experience. Furthermore, it allowed students 
of different disciplines to come together, exercise team building and polish their communication 
skills. NSUCEC also organize fun events including one day tours  and sporting events consisting 
of cricket and football tournaments.  
 
NSUCEC has still been performing brilliantly from its foundation. And it also plans to take its 
activities to an international level. Also, we started to collaborate with universities of different 
countries to organize international IT innovation and Engin eering Olympiads. Our motto is to 
organize events for the NSU students and to promote and spread the level of honor not just of 
the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) but of the whole School of 
Engineering and Physical Science (SEPS) o f NSU.
